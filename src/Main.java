  // Songs can be added to the end of the playlist in the order the user chooses, and the user can
  // skip to the next or previous song. Most operations involve adding songs and accessing them by

  // What would be a good choice of data structure?
  // YOUR ANSWER HERE

  //List, since we are indexing the position

  // Suppose you are developing a search feature that keeps track of the user's
  // recent search queries. You want to store the queries in the order they were made,
  // so you can display them to the user for quick access. The number of recent searches is
  // relatively small, and it is more important to preserve the order of the searches than
  // to optimize for fast lookups or deletions.
  // What would be a good choice of data structure?
  // YOUR ANSWER HERE

  //List, assuming doing a loop using length to get index last added
